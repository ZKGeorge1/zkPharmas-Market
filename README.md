# A-zkPharmas-Market
A zkPharma's Market is designed as an online pharmaceutical marketplace using validity proofs to regulate sales: individuals can buy a range of drugs, from regulated pharmacies, without the user/patient ever having to reveal their identity. The marketplace would use zero-knowledge proofs to prove that the patient has the required prescription to be able to purchase a specific drug at a specific dose without having to reveal personal information about identity, or location. This marketplace would increase competition across pharmacies, utilising economies of scale to reduce costs for patients. The licensed healthcare professional issuing a prescription broadcasts a transaction to the Mina blockchain that generates a proof containing the patient’s identity (hashed), the prescription details such as the drug name and dosage, the prescription expiry date, and their own professional licensing information (hashed) - which can be verified against a trusted database of medical practitioners. The patient submits this proof to the pharmaceutical marketplace to be able to purchase the drug that they have been prescribed for. The patient’s identity information stays hidden, but the system can verify that the data matches the expected structure and that the prescription is signed by a licensed healthcare professional. The pharmaceutical marketplace processes the order and sends it to a designated local post office, labelled with a salted hash of the patient’s name, which is anonymous. The patient is able to pick it up due to knowledge of their chosen salt value, and thus by providing the correct hash. All these transactions would be recorded on the blockchain for auditability and transparency, without compromising user privacy.
